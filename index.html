       <pre><em>
Confidence is a treasure, oh so rare,
With it, you'll soar high, without a care.
It's the wind beneath your wings, the light in your eyes,
Guiding you forward, reaching for the skies.
        
With confidence, fears tend to melt away,
And obstacles shrink, no longer in your way.
Believe in yourself, in all that you do,
For confidence will always see you through.
        
So hold your head high, and walk with pride,
Let your confidence be your guide.
For in the journey of life, you'll come to see,
Confidence unlocks the doors to all possibility.
